You can find me on GitHub (as FreeleX) or on Nightingale forums or on getsatisfaction.com

Instructions:
-------------
You can use UnityIntegration-latest.xpi file (which may update frequenly), 
but if it is for the first time several actions MUST be done in case you installed Songbird\Nightingale not from a package:
1. Edit nightingale.desktop or\and songbird.desktop files with text editor and change lines started with Exec= and TryExec= and change paths to point to your Nightingale or\and Songbird executable scripts.
2. Copy nightingale.desktop or\and songbird.desktop files to /usr/share/applications/ folder.
3. Copy nightingale.xpm or\and songbird.xpm files to /usr/share/pixmaps/ folder.
4. You may need to relogin (I'm not sure about it).
